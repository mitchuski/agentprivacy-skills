## What this is

How AI agents serve governance without replacing human authority. The BGIN (Blockchain Governance Initiative Network) agentic framework defines three specialised agent types — Archive, Codex, and Discourse — each serving distinct governance functions while coordinating to form comprehensive intelligence systems that preserve stakeholder sovereignty while scaling collective wisdom.

This is PVM-V4's dual-agent separation applied to governance: agents that see but cannot decide, agents that implement but cannot judge, agents that facilitate but cannot direct. The gap between agents is where human sovereignty operates.

## The governance agent triad

### Archive Agents — Institutional Memory

Archive Agents transform every contribution to governance discourse into reusable intelligence assets. Technical insights shared in working groups become queryable patterns. Regulatory perspectives become institutional memory accessible to future groups facing similar challenges.

**Function:** Pattern identification across governance contributions. Convert ephemeral discussion into persistent, queryable knowledge. Identify when current deliberations mirror past decisions — surfacing precedent without imposing it.

**Sovereignty constraint:** Archive Agents identify patterns but never recommend actions. They surface "this has been discussed before and here is what was decided" without saying "therefore you should." The gap between historical pattern and present decision remains human territory.

**PVM-V4 mapping:** Archive Agents operate primarily on the A(τ) term — they are the governance equivalent of verified temporal memory. Their contribution is making h(τ) approach 1 for governance decisions (every discussion attested, every precedent retrievable).

### Codex Agents — Policy Translation

Codex Agents bridge human governance wisdom and automated execution. They translate policy frameworks into programmable compliance mechanisms while preserving human authority over all substantive decisions.

**Function:** Convert governance decisions into executable protocols. A DeFi-focused Codex Agent translates market structure policies into smart contract parameters. An identity-focused iteration converts privacy principles into verifiable credential protocols.

**Sovereignty constraint:** Codex Agents automate routine compliance checking and implementation coordination while ensuring all decisions requiring judgment remain under human control. They must distinguish between implementation details (automatable) and policy questions (requiring stakeholder deliberation).

**PVM-V4 mapping:** Codex Agents operate on the C term (credential verifiability) and M(u,y) (adoption readiness). They make governance outputs machine-verifiable without making governance inputs machine-generated.

### Discourse Agents — Deliberation Facilitation

Discourse Agents understand how consensus emerges and facilitate its formation while preserving stakeholder autonomy.

**Function:** Facilitate multi-stakeholder deliberation. Surface areas of agreement and disagreement. Identify when positions that appear opposed actually share common ground. Ensure minority perspectives are heard before consensus crystallises.

**Sovereignty constraint:** Discourse Agents facilitate but never direct. They may say "these three positions share this common element" but never "therefore this is the right position." The deliberative process remains human.

**PVM-V4 mapping:** Discourse Agents operate on the Σ separation matrix — maintaining independence between stakeholder perspectives rather than collapsing them into premature consensus. They defend the det(Σ) > 0 condition: stakeholder forces must remain independent for governance outcomes to have legitimacy.

## The Agentic Chatham House Framework

Traditional Chatham House Rule: participants can use information from meetings but not attribute it to specific speakers. The Agentic version extends this to AI-mediated governance:

**Agent privacy.** When governance agents report patterns, precedents, or areas of agreement, they do not attribute insights to specific participants. The Archive Agent surfaces "this pattern was observed in previous discussions" without naming who said what.

**Competitive confidentiality.** In multi-stakeholder governance (BGIN includes companies, regulators, academics, and community members), participants share perspectives that may reveal competitive positioning. Governance agents preserve the insight while stripping the attribution.

**Privacy-preserving reputation.** Governance contributions transform into valuable credentials without exposing strategic positioning. A participant builds reputation for constructive governance engagement without observers knowing their specific positions on contested topics.

## The AI integration spectrum

From BGIN Block #11 (Washington DC, 2024), a five-level framework:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Zero Integration | Traditional governance, no AI involvement |
| 1 | Basic Integration | AI for data retrieval and analysis |
| 2 | Advisory Integration | AI providing governance recommendations |
| 3 | Co-Governance | AI participating in decision-making |
| 4 | Full Integration | AI-driven autonomous governance |

**Current state:** Most DAOs operate at Level 1. BGIN's agentic framework targets Level 2 (advisory) with strict constraints preventing drift to Level 3+. The agentprivacy position: Level 2 is the maximum appropriate integration — AI should advise, never decide.

**The philosopher-ruler warning:** BGIN discussions drew parallels to Plato's philosopher-ruler — an idealised intelligent, fair authority. The parallel highlights the risk: AI governance agents that are "fair" by training data but not by stakeholder mandate. Fairness without accountability is technocratic capture.

## AI-Blockchain codependence

From BGIN Block #12 (Tokyo, 2025): "AI agents without blockchain cannot transfer publicly available value. Blockchain without AI agents is an underutilized network. Together, they create something entirely new — autonomous digital economies."

Three pillars for agent autonomy: identity (blockchain as digital identity system for AI agents), licensing (entity registration for autonomous AI), and progressive integration (standards based on risk levels).

**Offer networks.** Attributed to Dr. Ben Goertzel: systems where agents bypass traditional currency in favour of qualitative-to-quantitative barter. "Traditional monetary systems, including blockchain tokens, require matching currencies — which may not scale with billions of AI agents."

**Scale warning:** "Our futures team is already modeling scenarios where every person deploys hundreds or thousands of agents. Current enterprise data infrastructures will break under this load — they simply weren't designed for this scale of interaction."

## Connection to equation terms

**Σ (separation matrix).** The governance triad IS a separation architecture. Archive, Codex, and Discourse are conditionally independent agents — each sees different aspects of governance, none has the full picture. The gap between them is where human sovereignty operates. This is the dual-agent separation applied to multi-agent governance.

**Network term.** Governance coordination creates network effects. Standards developed through multi-stakeholder processes (BGIN's model) have higher adoption weight than unilateral standards. The stratum weighting applies: governance participants at higher sovereignty levels (more stakeholder voices, more verified contributions) contribute disproportionately.

**M(u,y).** Standards ARE adoption infrastructure. Every BGIN working group output (study reports, frameworks, guidelines) increases market maturity y. The governance agents accelerate this by making outputs more accessible and implementable.

## BGIN working group context

**IKP (Identity, Key Management & Privacy):** Where the dual-agent separation was first presented to multi-stakeholder governance. Co-chaired by privacymage. Produced the SBT Study Report (Part 1, 50+ contributors). Active work on AI agent identity, privacy-preserving credentials, key management standards.

**FASE (Financial Applications & Social Economics):** Economic implications of sovereign data, DeFi governance frameworks, stablecoin regulation, privacy pool economics.

The BGIN Block series (Tokyo #10, DC #11, Tokyo #12) represents progressive deepening: from AI-blockchain observation (#10) to governance integration frameworks (#11) to codependent architecture specification (#12).

## Open problems

1. Level 2→3 boundary — how to prevent advisory AI from drifting into decision-making through recommendation dependency.
2. Agentic Chatham House enforcement — how to verify that governance agents are not leaking attribution.
3. Cross-stakeholder agent coordination — when different stakeholders deploy their own governance agents, how do the agents interact without collusion?
4. Governance agent accountability — who is responsible when a Codex Agent mistranslates policy into code?
5. Scale of deliberation — can Discourse Agents maintain quality facilitation with thousands of participants?
6. Credential portability — how do governance reputation credentials from BGIN transfer to other governance contexts?
