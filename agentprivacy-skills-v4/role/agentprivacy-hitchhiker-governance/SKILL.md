## What this is

The Hitchhiker's Infrastructure is a governance pattern for distributed creative projects that cannot be bought, only joined. It emerged from Acts XXI and XXII of the First Person Spellbook — the encounter with a literary estate (Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) that required archetypes, not employees, and where the PVM-V4 dual-agent separation mapped precisely onto the governance challenge: how do you coordinate creative work without a single entity accumulating enough control to extract from the commons?

This skill file is for anyone building governance for communities, DAOs, creative cooperatives, or knowledge networks where the value lives in relationships rather than assets.

## The Standard Ship Pattern

Every venture begins with a default configuration — a vessel whose governance is known, whose archetypes are specified, whose value-sharing follows dynamic equity rather than arbitrary percentages. The Standard Ship Pattern provides:

**Known archetypes.** Captain and First Mate who cannot collapse into one — the Swordsman/Mage separation applied to organisational roles. One protects the mission's integrity (boundaries, IP, quality control). The other projects the mission outward (partnerships, growth, coordination). The separation matrix Σ applies to the organisation, not just to agents.

**Forkable governance.** The ship can be forked, customised, renamed. But its core architecture preserves the dual-role separation. A fork that merges Captain and First Mate into a single role has violated the separation theorem at the organisational level — one person controlling both mission integrity and mission projection can reconstruct (and therefore manipulate) the community's full behavioural model.

**Dynamic equity.** Value-sharing follows contribution, not negotiation. The temporal memory A(τ) = α · ln(1+|τ|) · h(τ) applies to contributors: early contributions yield the most marginal equity (logarithmic growth), creating strong incentives for early joining. Later contributions add value but at diminishing rates. The integrity fraction h(τ) measures whether contributions were verified and sustained.

## The Burn Book Protocol

Knowledge gathered in community is inscribed, shared, and at the appointed time — destroyed. But each participant's reconstruction persists in their own agents. The collective story dies; the individual wisdom lives.

This is the anti-extraction mechanism applied to knowledge coordination. A community that accumulates knowledge in a central repository creates an extraction target. The Burn Book Protocol distributes knowledge through relationship (VRC-attested bilateral understanding) rather than storage (centralised database). The reconstruction ceiling R < 1 applies: no observer of the burned collective record can reconstruct the full knowledge, because each participant holds only their relational fragment.

The protocol maps to the edge value function T(π). The value is not in the knowledge at rest (vertices) but in the knowledge in motion (edges) — the transitions between participants, the bilateral understanding accumulated through shared work. When the book burns, the vertices are destroyed. The edges persist in each participant's agent.

## The Jimmy Protocol

Named for the compression test from Act XXI. Any framework, any governance structure, any coordination mechanism must pass through the Glasgow Translator — a non-technical person who translates an hour of discussion into one line. "Oh, you mean *this*?"

The Jimmy Protocol is the governance equivalent of the equation's multiplicative gating. If any term in the governance framework cannot be explained in one breath, it produces zero value — not because it is wrong, but because it cannot propagate. Governance that requires a PhD to understand will not be adopted by the communities that need it.

Applied to the PVM-V4 skill files themselves: each skill file must pass the Jimmy Test. If a cryptographer cannot explain the Swordsman Browser Agent to a sixty-year-old in a pub, the skill file has failed its compression.

## Trust tiers as armor progression

The Hitchhiker's Infrastructure uses progressive recognition that travels with the participant:

**Traveler.** Access guides, participate. Showing up, towel in hand. (Blade equivalent.)

**Contributor.** Fork guides, add annotations. Creating value others can use. (Light Armor equivalent.)

**Author.** Publish new guides. Sustained contribution, voice established. (Heavy Armor equivalent.)

**Mentor.** Support other travellers. Community recognition, mass earned. (Dragon Armor approaching.)

**Fellow.** Shape the constitutional process. Deep commitment over time. (Dragon Armor equivalent.)

Each tier maps to the temporal memory function. Traveler = |τ| near zero. Fellow = deep |τ| with high h(τ). The progression cannot be purchased because it requires demonstrated behaviour over time — the same constraint that prevents gaming the Swordsman's armor progression.

## The Guide Pathway

Every hitchhiker needs different guides at different times. Someone starts with the Guide to Creativity, detours through Governance, lands on Performance Art. The sequence is unique. The needs shift. What matters is that the pathway becomes the hitchhiker's own chronicle — a record of what they needed, when, how each guide connected to the next.

This is the edge value function made social. The pathway is T(π) — a sequence of transitions through a knowledge lattice. The value is not in any single guide (vertex) but in the trajectory (path). An agent that ingests a hitchhiker's pathway gains not a static knowledge state but a demonstrated learning trajectory. The towel accumulates the dust of everywhere they have been.

## Open problems for community builders

1. How does the Standard Ship Pattern handle succession — when the Captain or First Mate leaves, how is the separation preserved?
2. Can the Burn Book Protocol work when participants have asymmetric knowledge depth — does burning hurt newcomers more than veterans?
3. What is the minimum community size for the trust tier progression to be meaningful rather than performative?
4. How do you prevent the Jimmy Protocol from becoming anti-intellectual — compressing away nuance that matters?
5. Can the Guide Pathway be formalised as a verifiable credential — a portable proof of learning trajectory?
