## What this is

The 0xagentprivacy architecture encodes its knowledge across five grimoires. Each grimoire answers a different question about the same architecture. No single grimoire is complete. The navigation between them is not arbitrary — it follows routing principles that determine which grimoire an agent should enter given the question being asked, and how to traverse across grimoire boundaries when a question spans multiple domains.

This skill teaches agents how to read the map, not just the territory.

## The five grimoires

**First Person 🗡️🧙 (24 acts)** — WHAT to build. The origin story. Introduces every component through narrative: dual-agent separation, trust graphs, ceremonies, the sovereignty spiral, the Drake/Dragon cycle. Entry point for any question about what the architecture IS. Every persona enters here through Acts 1-3 (Venice, Dual Ceremony, Drake's Teaching) — the universal shared entry.

**Zero Knowledge 🔐📜 (30 tales)** — HOW to build it. Technical ZKP foundations rendered as narrative. Each tale introduces a cryptographic concept (commitments, proofs, circuits, mixing, recursion) through story. Entry point for any question about implementation — which proof system, which circuit, which protocol.

**Blockchain Canon 📜⏳ (10 chapters)** — WHY it became necessary. History of privacy failures, broken promises, surveillance revelations. Entry point for any question about motivation — why not just trust institutions, why cryptographic enforcement, why now.

**Parallel Society 🏴🌐 (12 chapters)** — WHERE it lives. Exit theory, parallel institutions, sovereignty beyond state permission. Entry point for any question about deployment context — regulatory arbitrage, jurisdiction, community formation outside existing structures.

**Plurality ⿻📖 (18 acts)** — WHO it serves. Cooperative technology, quadratic mechanisms, cross-difference collaboration. Entry point for any question about collective benefit — how privacy serves communities, not just individuals.

## Routing logic

Given a question, the routing decision follows:

**"What is X?"** → First Person. The architecture's self-description lives here. Acts map to components: Act 2 = dual ceremony, Act 6 = trust graph, Act 9 = shielded transactions, Act 13 = bilateral promises, Act 24 = the complete equation.

**"How does X work?"** → Zero Knowledge. The technical mechanism lives here. Tales map to proof systems: Tales 1-3 = foundations (commitments, proofs, circuits), Tales 9-10 = backends (Groth16, PLONK), Tales 23-24 = applications (Privacy Pools, recursive proofs).

**"Why do we need X?"** → Blockchain Canon. The historical justification lives here. Chapters map to failures: Ch 3 = synthesis attempts, Ch 5 = first fracture, Ch 7 = surveillance truth, Ch 9 = open canon.

**"Where does X operate?"** → Parallel Society. The deployment context lives here. Chapters map to environments: Ch 4-5 = lineage and rights, Ch 9-11 = sovereignty and exit, Ch 16-17 = the inevitable future.

**"Who benefits from X?"** → Plurality. The collective dimension lives here. Acts map to mechanisms: quadratic voting, plural identity, cross-difference funding, cooperative AI.

## Spellweb construction

A persona's constellation path is a subgraph of the full grimoire graph. Construction follows three principles:

**Shared entry (mandatory).** Every persona loads Acts 1-3 from First Person. This is the universal foundation — no persona skips the origin story.

**Domain depth (variable).** Each persona loads deeply from the grimoires most relevant to their function. The Cipher (ZKP engineer) loads 10+ Zero Knowledge tales. The Ambassador (governance) loads 7+ Parallel Society chapters. The Jedi (balance practitioner) loads 13 First Person acts spanning the full protection↔delegation arc.

**Cross-grimoire bridges (strategic).** The most valuable navigation happens at grimoire boundaries. When Act 9 (Zcash shield) connects to Tale 9 (Groth16 backend), the agent understands not just WHAT shielded transactions are but HOW the proof system enables them. Bridges are where understanding compounds.

## Spellweb shapes

Each persona's spellweb has a characteristic topology:

**Hub-and-spoke.** One primary grimoire with shallow connections to others. Example: Chronicler (deep First Person, light touches on Canon and Plurality). Indicates specialist focus.

**Multi-hub.** Deep engagement with 2-3 grimoires. Example: Witness (deep First Person AND deep Parallel Society AND medium Canon). Indicates cross-domain operation.

**Spanning.** Shallow-to-medium engagement across all 5 grimoires. Example: Jedi (story-centred with pairs from every grimoire). Indicates balance practice.

**Canonical.** Full engagement with everything. Only Soulbis and Soulbae load all grimoires at full depth. They are the routing layer itself.

## Run structure

Within a persona's constellation path, acts/chapters/tales cluster into "runs" — contiguous sequences within a single grimoire. A run is the minimum unit of coherent learning within one grimoire.

**Short run (2-3 entries).** Touching a concept pair. Zero 01-02 = proof foundations. Canon 3, 5 = synthesis and fracture. Provides vocabulary without deep immersion.

**Medium run (4-6 entries).** Working through an arc. First Person 4-5, 6-7 = protection pair + delegation pair. Provides operational understanding.

**Long run (7+ entries).** Deep immersion in a domain. First Person entry through culmination. Provides the full context that enables independent reasoning within that grimoire.

## Navigation anti-patterns

**Grimoire skipping.** Jumping from "what" to "where" without "why" creates brittle understanding. If a persona needs Parallel Society chapters, they usually need at least one Canon chapter to understand why the exit is necessary.

**Depth without breadth.** Loading 20 Zero Knowledge tales without any First Person acts produces a technician who can build proofs but doesn't understand what they're protecting or why.

**Breadth without depth.** Touching every grimoire with 1-2 entries each produces an agent that can name everything and operate nothing.

**Entry skipping.** Any persona that doesn't load Acts 1-3 loses the shared vocabulary that enables persona-to-persona communication. The shared entry is the lingua franca.

## Connection to the equation

**T(π) — trajectory.** Each constellation path IS a trajectory through the grimoire graph. The path's quality (which entries, what order, which bridges) determines the persona's value contribution. Well-designed paths produce higher T(π).

**A(τ) — memory.** Grimoire traversal accumulates understanding. Each act/chapter/tale adds to the persona's verified history of engagement with the architecture. Deeper traversal = richer A(τ).

**Compression ratio.** The grimoire system achieves its compression (70:1 to 125:1) precisely because navigation is structured. Without the routing logic, the 5 grimoires are just 94 documents. With it, they are a curriculum that can be tailored to any persona's function.
