## Policy problem

Current privacy regulation treats privacy as a compliance cost — something to manage, minimise, and offset against utility. PVM-V4 reframes privacy as value-generating infrastructure. The model provides a formal economic basis for policy positions that treat privacy investment as productive rather than defensive.

## What the model shows regulators

**The surveillance gap is structural, not incremental.** Under PVM-V4 parameterisation, sovereign architectures produce 17×–12,000× more economic value than surveillance equivalents. This is not a marginal difference resolved by better consent flows. The gap arises because surveillance systems are topologically constrained: activating meaningful privacy protection breaks the extraction pipelines they depend on. Retrofit is architecturally infeasible — privacy must be built in from the start.

**Privacy investment shows superlinear returns.** The privacy strength term P is raised to exponent 1.5, reflecting empirical observation that each increment of cryptographic enforcement yields more than proportional value. Half-measures (P = 0.5) produce only ~35% of the value of full enforcement (P = 1.0). This directly challenges regulatory approaches that accept "reasonable" privacy as sufficient.

**Unverified claims contribute zero value.** The temporal memory term A(τ) is gated by h(τ), the proportion of state transitions carrying cryptographic proof. Self-attested privacy claims with h(τ) = 0 produce no accumulated value regardless of history length. This provides formal support for standards requiring verifiable credentials over self-declaration.

## Alignment with existing frameworks

**IEEE 7012 (MyTerms).** The model's dual-agent architecture — Swordsman (privacy boundaries) and Mage (delegation) — directly implements the MyTerms vision of individual terms that mediate data relationships. The separation matrix Σ formalises what MyTerms describes qualitatively: the requirement that terms-setting and terms-execution remain functionally independent.

**Trust Over IP.** The 64-vertex sovereignty lattice maps to Trust Over IP's layer model. Each binary sovereignty dimension corresponds to an infrastructure capability (cryptographic enforcement, credential verifiability, network participation, etc.). The stratum concept — how many capabilities are simultaneously active — provides a measurable governance maturity metric.

**Promise Theory.** PVM-V4 inherits from Bergstra & Burgess's Promise Theory the principle that agents are autonomous promise-making entities. Cooperation is voluntary, not imposed. The model's multiplicative structure enforces this: you cannot compensate for missing sovereignty in one dimension by excelling in another. Each dimension represents an independent promise that must be kept.

**BGIN Identity & Key Management.** The reconstruction resistance proof — R_max = (C_S + C_M)/H(X) < 1 — provides a formal bound on what any adversary (including regulators) can learn from observing agent outputs. This gives identity governance frameworks a mathematical ceiling on surveillance capability under compliant architectures, enabling proportionate oversight without architectural compromise.

## Policy implications

**For data protection authorities.** The multiplicative gating property means privacy frameworks with any single zero-scored dimension produce zero total value. A system with excellent encryption but no credential verifiability, or perfect credentials but no network, generates no economic privacy value. Regulation should require minimum thresholds across all dimensions rather than excellence in any single one.

**For competition policy.** The network effect term (1 + Σ wᵢ nᵢ/N₀)^k shows that privacy network value follows power-law dynamics weighted by sovereignty stratum. This means early privacy infrastructure builders gain compounding advantages. The policy window to establish competitive privacy alternatives before surveillance architectures achieve irreversible network effects is finite and narrowing.

**For AI governance.** The dual-agent separation theorem proves that a single AI agent managing both privacy boundaries and delegation goals can reconstruct its principal's complete behavioural model. This has direct implications for AI agent regulation: architectures that combine privacy management and action execution in a single system are structurally incapable of preserving human sovereignty, regardless of policy constraints imposed on them.

**For standards bodies.** The model provides quantifiable metrics for sovereignty maturity (stratum level), separation quality (det(Σ)), and verified history depth (A(τ)). These can serve as measurable conformance criteria rather than qualitative best-practice guidance.

## The window argument

The model's network effect term creates a formal basis for urgency. Privacy-preserving and surveillance architectures compete for the same network effects. Once either achieves sufficient adoption (high n_i/N₀), the power-law exponent k makes switching costs prohibitive. The current period — before either architecture class dominates agent infrastructure — is the critical window for establishing privacy-first standards and governance frameworks.

## Governance-relevant open questions

1. Who calibrates the model parameters (α, β, λ) and what governance structure ensures neutrality?
2. Can the sovereignty stratum metric be adopted as a compliance measurement without mandating specific technology?
3. How does the model interact with jurisdiction-specific data localisation requirements?
4. What governance framework ensures the separation matrix Σ is honestly reported by system operators?
