## What this is

The 0xagentprivacy model uses spellbooks to compress knowledge and narrative compression to encode reasoning patterns. The holonic architecture provides BRAID — shared reasoning graphs as structured data. Together they enable persistent, provider-agnostic reasoning artefacts that many agents can share across environments without recomputing.

The core insight: reasoning is expensive. Validated reasoning is valuable. If reasoning artefacts persist and can be shared, the network effects compound. One agent's careful analysis becomes a library entry that benefits all agents — privacy-preserving collective intelligence.

## BRAID reasoning graphs

BRAID (from the holonic architecture) structures reasoning as directed graphs:

**Nodes.** Assertions, questions, evidence, conclusions. Each node is typed with its epistemic status.

**Edges.** Inference relationships. "A supports B", "C contradicts D", "E is evidence for F". Edge types capture reasoning structure.

**Mermaid encoding.** Graphs are serialised as Mermaid diagrams — human-readable, version-controllable, diff-able.

**Holon storage.** Each BRAID graph is stored as a holon. The graph content is the holon payload. Graph metadata (domain, author if disclosed, validation status) is in holon MetaData.

## Reasoning graph libraries

Individual reasoning graphs combine into libraries:

**Parent-child structure.** A library is a parent holon. Individual graphs are children. `LoadHolonsForParentAsync(libraryId, HolonType.ReasoningGraph)` retrieves all graphs in a domain.

**Domain organisation.** Libraries organised by domain: `ZKP-circuits`, `privacy-threat-models`, `sovereignty-economics`, `dark-forest-strategies`. Agents load the library for their current task.

**MetaData queryability.** Graph MetaData enables discovery without loading full content. Query: "all graphs about TEE vulnerabilities with validation status = peer-reviewed". Load only matching holons.

## Learn-once-reuse-everywhere

The economic thesis: reasoning should be computed once and reused infinitely.

**Proof graphs.** A ZKP circuit design is a reasoning graph. Once the circuit is proven correct, the graph becomes a library entry. Other agents reference the graph rather than re-deriving the circuit.

**Threat model graphs.** An analysis of a specific attack vector is a reasoning graph. Once validated, it enters the threat library. Agents facing similar threats load and adapt rather than analyse from scratch.

**Integration graphs.** This integration document could be a reasoning graph. The analysis of how holonic architecture maps to 0xagentprivacy becomes reusable knowledge.

**Spell encoding as graph compression.** The narrative compression skill produces spells — symbolic notation that compresses reasoning. These map to graph summaries: the spell is the compressed pointer; the full graph is the expansion.

## Agent memory as holon trees

The dual-agent architecture needs memory structures:

**Soulbis memory tree:**
```
Soulbis Root Holon (shielded providers)
├── Knowledge Children (domain expertise)
├── Boundary Children (privacy rules, enforcement history)
├── Threat Children (active threat assessments)
└── Key Children (cryptographic material references)
```

**Soulbae memory tree:**
```
Soulbae Root Holon (neutral/public providers)
├── Delegation Children (active delegation state)
├── Coordination Children (multi-agent session state)
├── Capability Children (available actions, permissions)
└── Communication Children (Oracle channel state)
```

**Oracle communication holons:**
- Stored on neutral providers
- End-to-end encrypted content
- MetaData minimal (timestamp, session ID)
- Both agents can read; neither holds exclusively

## Privacy-preserving shared reasoning

Sharing reasoning without leaking behaviour:

**Anonymous contribution.** Graphs in libraries don't require attribution. The graph's validity is independent of its author. Agents contribute to libraries without exposing their reasoning patterns.

**Shielded vs public libraries.** Swordsman reasoning graphs (boundary analysis, threat assessment) stay in shielded libraries. Mage reasoning graphs (coordination patterns, delegation logic) can be in public libraries. Cross-library references require careful handling.

**Access via ZK proof.** An agent accessing a private library can prove "I am a member of guild X" without revealing their specific identity. Library access doesn't leak individual agent behaviour.

**Contribution via mixing.** Contributions to shared libraries can be routed through mixing — the library accepts the graph but cannot link it to a specific contributor.

## Integration with existing skills

**narrative_compression:** Spellbooks compress knowledge; BRAID structures reasoning. They're complementary — spells point to graphs, graphs expand to full reasoning chains.

**spell_encoding:** Symbolic notation encodes reasoning graphs. A spell is a compressed graph reference. Decoding expands the symbol to its full graph structure.

**knowledgegraph:** The existing knowledge graph skill covers entity relationships. BRAID adds epistemic relationships — not just "A relates to B" but "A is evidence for B with strength 0.7".

**grimoire_navigation:** Grimoire structure maps to library navigation. Each grimoire section is a library; each spell entry references one or more reasoning graphs.

**intel_pooling:** Intel Pools are shared intelligence. Holonic reasoning makes Intel Pool contents persistent, structured, and queryable.

## Operational patterns

**Graph creation.** Agent performs reasoning → captures as BRAID graph → validates internally → assigns holon GUID → stores with appropriate provider routing.

**Graph validation.** Peer review: other agents examine graph structure → attest to validity → add validation signatures to MetaData. Automated: formal verification tools check graph consistency.

**Graph discovery.** Agent has task → queries relevant library by MetaData → loads promising graphs → adapts to current context → cites source graphs in new reasoning.

**Graph evolution.** Original graph has gap → new agent extends reasoning → creates new version (if immutable pattern violated, creates child instead) → library accumulates refinements.

## Open problems

1. **Reasoning provenance** — how to track which agent contributed which reasoning without full attribution?
2. **Graph versioning semantics** — when is a graph extension a new version vs a new graph?
3. **Cross-library references** — how to safely reference shielded library graphs from public libraries?
4. **Reasoning validity decay** — do reasoning graphs become stale? How to model epistemic decay?
5. **Adversarial graphs** — how to prevent malicious graphs from polluting libraries? Validation requirements?
