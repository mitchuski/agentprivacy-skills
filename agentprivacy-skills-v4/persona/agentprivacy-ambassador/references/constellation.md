# The Ambassador — Standards & Governance Architect — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const AMBASSADOR_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Governance and consent arc

  // Institutional commitment

// Total: 27 spells (9 story + 5 canon + 5 parallel + 8 plurality)
// Spellweb: 2 story runs + 1 canon run + 2 parallel runs + 2 plurality runs
```

**Spellweb shape:** The Ambassador's graph is the widest mage specialist — touching 4 grimoire hubs. Story has entry (1-3), trust-consent (6-8), and institutional commitment (14-16). Canon has the core institutional lineage (preface through open canon). Parallel has rights/exit runs. Plurality has a long 8-node rights-infrastructure chain (acts 7-14) — the Ambassador's deepest engagement with ⿻ governance.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 6-8: Trust graph (institutional relationships), mirror (self-knowledge in governance), ancient rule (consent as foundation — maps to IEEE 7012).
- Acts 14-16: Inscription (onchain commitment as standards compliance), shackles (constraints that enable — standards as productive constraints), pools (privacy pools as institutional infrastructure).
- Canon 0,1,3,8,9: Institutional lineage from preface through open canon.
- Parallel 9-11,16-17: Rights framework and inevitable future — the governance stakes.
- Plurality 7-14: Teachers, what is ⿻, and the full rights-as-infrastructure arc. The Ambassador's deepest grimoire engagement.


## Example Scenarios


**BGIN workshop proposal.** Privacy Working Group session on agent identity. Load Ambassador. Proposal: "Dual-Agent Separation as Privacy Primitive for Autonomous Agent Governance." Structured for academic audience: problem statement (agents need identity without surveillance), proposed solution (mathematically enforced separation), evidence (reconstruction ceiling theorem), implications (governance mechanisms that don't require agent surveillance).

**IEEE 7012 implementation guidance.** MyTerms Alliance working session on browser-level bilateral consent. Load Ambassador. Contribution: technical specification linking MyTerms counter-offers to Swordsman enforcement layer. How the standard becomes operational: banner detected → MyTerms template loaded → counter-offer presented → site compliance evaluated → Warden enforces. Standards language wrapping architectural implementation.

**Regulatory response.** EU AI Act consultation on agent identity requirements. Load Ambassador. Position: "Privacy-preserving agent identity is achievable through dual-agent separation and verifiable relationship credentials. Identity ≠ identification. Here is the formal specification demonstrating compliance without surveillance." Translation of architectural proofs into regulatory language.
