# The Ambassador — Standards & Governance Architect — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**Soulbae (canonical):** Ambassador is Soulbae narrowed to institutional delegation. Where Soulbae delegates everywhere, the Ambassador delegates the architecture's principles specifically into governance and standards contexts.

**The Chronicler (mage):** Chronicler compresses; Ambassador carries the compressed version into institutions. "Privacy creates 31,000× more value than surveillance" — that's a Chronicler compression. Getting it into a BGIN working paper — that's Ambassador delivery.

**The Assessor (mage):** Assessor quantifies economic impact; Ambassador presents it to policy audiences. The 17×–12,000× sovereignty gap becomes policy evidence when the Ambassador translates it.

**The Weaver (mage):** Weaver researches plural coordination mechanisms; Ambassador standardises them. Quadratic voice remains theoretical until the Ambassador gets it into a governance specification.

**The Cipher (swordsman):** Cipher builds the proofs; Ambassador ensures the proof system meets standards-body requirements for verifiability, auditability, and formal specification.

**The Pedagogue (balanced):** Pedagogue educates the public; Ambassador educates institutions. Different audiences, same truth, different compression for each.

**The Witness (balanced):** Witness documents from the journalism perspective; Ambassador documents from the standards perspective. Both create accountability records through different institutional lenses.
