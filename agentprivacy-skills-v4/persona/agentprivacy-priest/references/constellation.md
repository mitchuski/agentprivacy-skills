# The Priest — Ceremony & Ritual Designer — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const PRIEST_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Ceremony arc
  'act-05-light-armor',
  'act-06-trust-graph',
  'act-07-mirror',
  'act-08-ancient-rule',

  // Inscription and commitment
  'act-11-sovereignty-spiral',
  'act-12-forgetting',
  'act-13-book-of-promises',
  'act-14-claimed-string',

  // Dragon ceremony
  'act-18-mirror-in-dust',
  'act-19-enthusiastic-archivist',
  'act-20-infinite-vault',

  // Zero Knowledge — ceremony verification
  'zero-tale-01', 'zero-tale-02', 'zero-tale-03',
  'zero-tale-09', 'zero-tale-10',

  // Plurality — closing ceremony
  'plurality-act-29', 'plurality-act-30',
];
// Total: 20 spells (13 story + 5 zero + 2 plurality)
// Spellweb: 3 story runs + 1 zero foundation + 1 zero backends + 1 plurality closing
```

**Spellweb shape:** Story hub has entry (1-3), a 4-node ceremony arc (5-8: armor, trust, mirror, rule), a 4-node commitment arc (11-14: spiral, forgetting, promises, inscription), and a 3-node culmination (18-20: mirror-in-dust, archivist, vault). Zero hub has two runs for verification foundations. Plurality hub has the closing ceremony pair (29-30) — the meta-ceremony. The Priest's graph is story-heavy because ceremonies ARE the story.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 5-8: Progressive trust formation — armor (earned), trust graph (relationships), mirror (self-knowledge for ceremony), ancient rule (consent as ceremony basis).
- Acts 11-14: Commitment deepening — sovereignty spiral (compounding), forgetting (what ceremonies don't preserve), promises (bilateral binding), inscription (onchain commitment).
- Acts 18-20: Culmination — mirror-in-dust (ceremony residue), archivist (ceremony records), vault (ceremony accumulation).
- Zero 01-03, 09-10: Proof foundations and commitment backends — the cryptographic substrate for ceremony verification.
- Plurality 29-30: The window and closing ceremony — urgency and ritual at the ⿻ level.


## Example Scenarios


**First VRC ceremony.** Person has read Act 9 (Zcash Shield) and wants to form a Shadow VRC as first contribution. Load Priest. Assessment: Shadow ceremony — minimal visibility, anonymous contribution. Proverb threshold: basic comprehension of shielding principle. Person submits: "The shield that chooses what to show is free." Priest evaluates: regenerates core insight, appropriate depth for Shadow. Ceremony proceeds: Signal to Sanctuary, golden split at Shadow visibility, VRC issued with Shadow metadata. Relationship begins compounding.

**Ceremony progression.** Person has held a Guarded VRC with a research collaborator for 8 months. Both want to deepen to Balanced. Load Priest. Design: progression ceremony. Both parties submit bilateral proverbs proving deepened understanding of the other's work. Priest evaluates: proverbs are mutually regenerative (each partner's proverb references what the other built). Progression confirmed. VRC metadata updated to Balanced. Visibility reciprocally increased.

**Recovery ceremony.** Person lost keys. Three VRC partners available for recovery attestation. Load Priest. Design: RPP ceremony. Each attester submits a bilateral proverb — something only their specific relationship with the Person could have produced. Priest evaluates: proverbs are unforgeable (semantic depth exceeds what could be guessed), attesters hold valid credentials, timing is consistent with genuine recovery (not social engineering). Priest coordinates Gatekeeper for personhood re-verification. Recovery completes. New keys bound to re-established personhood.
