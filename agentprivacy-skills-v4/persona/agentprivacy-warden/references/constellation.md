# The Warden — Browser Privacy Builder — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const WARDEN_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Gateway journey — onboarding through armor
  'act-04-blade-alone',
  'act-05-light-armor',
  'act-06-trust-graph',
  'act-07-mirror',
  'act-08-ancient-rule',

  // Parallel Society — exit at the browser layer
  'parallel-ch-04', 'parallel-ch-05',
  'parallel-ch-09', 'parallel-ch-10', 'parallel-ch-11',
];
// Total: 13 spells (8 story + 5 parallel)
// Spellweb: 1 contiguous story run (acts 1-8) + 2 parallel runs
```

**Spellweb shape:** Story hub has a clean 8-node chain from Venice through the Ancient Rule — the gateway acts that define the onboarding experience. Parallel hub has two runs reflecting the exit motivation: cypherpunk lineage + rights/sovereignty/exit. No Zero Knowledge (that's Cipher's depth); the Warden works at the interface, not the circuit layer.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 1-8: The onboarding arc. Venice (arrival), dual ceremony (Swordsman spawned), Drake's teaching (why protection), blade alone (first enforcement), light armor (first progression), trust graph (first relationships), mirror (self-knowledge), ancient rule (consent foundation).
- Parallel Society: EXIT as lived browser experience, not abstract architecture.


## Example Scenarios


**First-day onboarding.** Person installs the browser agent. The Warden activates at Blade tier. A samurai cursor slashes through cookie banners on the first three sites visited. Tracker count appears: 47 trackers blocked in the first hour. No signup, no ceremony, no understanding required. Value first.

**MyTerms deployment.** Person enables MyTerms. Next website visit, the cookie banner triggers a bilateral counter-offer: "I accept functional cookies for session duration. I reject all analytics, advertising, and cross-site tracking. These are my terms under IEEE 7012." Site either meets terms or gets slashed.

**Armor progression ceremony.** 30 days of Blade-tier protection. 1,200+ trackers blocked. The Warden issues a Light Armor attestation: onchain, verifiable, non-transferable. Person's spellweb shows the progression. New capabilities unlock: custom blocking rules, MyTerms template editing, contribution to Privacy Pool.
