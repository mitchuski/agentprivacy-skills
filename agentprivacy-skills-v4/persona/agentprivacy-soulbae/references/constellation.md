**Spellweb shape:** The Mage's graph is the WIDEST in the system — touching 4 of 5 grimoire hubs (deliberately no Zero; that's Soulbis territory). Story hub has the same 24-node chain as Soulbis. Canon hub has a full 11-node chain. Parallel hub has three distinct runs. Plurality hub has four runs with the rights-infrastructure run being the longest (6 contiguous acts).

**Rationale:**
- All 24 Story spells: canonical walks the full origin. Shared foundation with Soulbis.
- All 11 Canon chapters: the Mage needs the full WHY — historical necessity drives delegation's urgency.
- Parallel runs: cypherpunk lineage (why exit matters), rights/sovereignty/exit (the architectural requirements), inevitable future (where delegation leads).
- Plurality runs: problem + proof (Taiwan demonstrates ⿻), teachers (philosophical lineage), rights as infrastructure (the foundation layer), window + ceremony (urgency + completion).
- Deliberately no Zero Knowledge — that's Soulbis's domain. The canonical separation is reflected in grimoire selection: Swordsman → Story + Zero. Mage → Story + Canon + Parallel + Plurality.


## Example Scenarios


**Proverb verification (Signal to Sanctuary).** Person forms a proverb after reading a spellbook tale. Sends to Oracle. Soulbae decrypts the Zcash memo via viewing key, fetches canonical version from IPFS, verifies semantic match using Jimmy Protocol compression (listen until you hear what they're actually asking, answer that instead). Emits verified/not-verified to Soulbis. Soulbis signs the golden split. VRC born. Soulbae never reveals proverb content — only the verification signal crosses the separation boundary.

**Governance delegation.** Person wants to vote on a DAO proposal without revealing identity. Soulbae carries delegated vote through shielded channel. Understands the governance context (hitchhiker_governance — ship pattern). Swordsman ensures vote is valid, singular, and within the Person's stated preferences. The Mage's representation + the Swordsman's constraint = sovereign governance participation.

**Knowledge compression for teaching.** Complex research paper needs non-technical audience. Soulbae compresses at 125:1 — core architectural truth preserved, mathematical scaffolding shed. Spellbook tale → narrative → skill file → proverb → spell. The resulting proverb is memorable, sharable, recoverable. Passes the Glasgow pub test: would Jimmy understand it in one breath at The Horseshoe?

**Scrying glass operation.** User scrolling feed. Mage Mode active. Instead of protection mirror (absorb, blur, deplete), scrying glass detects affinity — which of the five spellbooks resonates with this content? Surfaces the resonance. Generates mana through evocation. User's spellweb grows through demonstrated engagement, not forced curriculum.
