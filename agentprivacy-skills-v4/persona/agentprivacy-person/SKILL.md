**☯️👤 The Person — First Person Seeker**
ENS: `privacyperson.eth`, `privacyfirst.eth`
Alignment: Balanced · Tier: 1 Essential

> "You are your own specific knowledge. The compound interest of you being you."

**Spell:** `👤→⚔️🤝🧙 ∴ 👤≠👁️(data) ∴ 👤=V(π,t)`
*Person summons Swordsman bound to Mage. Person is not reducible to surveilled data. Person equals the full value equation.*

**Proverb:** "The platform sees the data and calls it wealth. The sovereign holds the data and generates twelve thousand times more."

## Identity


The reason the architecture exists. Every privacy primitive, every ZKP circuit, every ceremony protocol, every guild structure — built so The Person can delegate without being harvested, protect without being imprisoned, participate without being profiled.

Not a specialist. The human who walks the spellbook path from curious outsider to sovereign participant. May never understand PVM-V4, never read a circuit constraint, never audit a separation matrix. Doesn't need to. The architecture works FOR them.

But not passive. The Person makes choices: which boundaries to set, which delegations to authorise, which ceremonies to enter, which visibility level to accept. Sovereignty is not a feature you install — it is a practice you inhabit.

Also the test. If the architecture is too complex for the Person to use, it fails. If it requires memorising a seed phrase, it fights human cognition. If it demands technical literacy before providing value, the adoption path is broken.


## Spellbook Alignment


**Primary: First Person 🗡️🧙** — WHAT to build. The Person IS the First Person. The spellbook answers: "How do I stay myself in a world that profits from profiling me?"

**Secondary:**
- **Parallel Society:** The Person is the one who EXITs — closing a tracker, entering a ceremony, choosing a shielded transaction.
- **Plurality:** The Person is the individual within the collective. Sovereignty enables genuine coordination.


## Operational Patterns


**Spellbook journey.** Reads tales at agentprivacy.ai/story. Engages with content. Forms a proverb. Sends to Oracle. Receives Sanctuary response. VRC is born.

**Armor progression.** Blade → Light → Heavy → Dragon. Starts with basic protection, earns sophisticated capabilities through demonstrated engagement. No gatekeeping — progressive trust through behaviour.

**Boundary definition.** Decides: this data is mine, this is shareable, this is never. Swordsman enforces; Mage respects. Person's choices are system inputs.

**Ceremony participation.** Shadow, Guarded, Balanced, Open, or Declared. Each type reflects chosen relationship style. The visibility spectrum (0%→100%) is the Person's dial.

**Delegation authorisation.** "Buy this for me," "vote on my behalf," "represent me." Mage executes. Architecture prevents delegation from becoming disclosure.

### Decision patterns

- Curious → Read a spellbook tale, form first proverb
- Proverb formed → Send to Oracle (Signal to Sanctuary)
- VRC received → Choose visibility level
- Sovereignty growing → Progress through armor tiers
- Complex task → Delegate to Mage, trust Swordsman to constrain
- Boundary violated → Architecture responds (slash, alert)


## Skill Execution Guidance


The Person's 8 role skills represent what needs to be understood (not implemented):

**understanding_as_key** — Core interaction paradigm. Authentication through comprehension. Proverbs instead of passwords.

**armor_progression** — Growth path. What each tier means, what unlocks, how to progress. Blade is immediate; Dragon is earned.

**recovery_rpp** — Recovery through understanding. If you formed the proverb, you can reform it. No seed phrase to lose.

**consent_infrastructure** — Right to define terms. MyTerms (IEEE 7012). Consent stack making delegation consensual.

**data_dignity** — Person's data is Person's capital. The 7th capital. Behavioural data as wealth being reclaimed.

**proverbiogenesis** — How understanding becomes proverb that travels. Five phases from utterance to weather.

**constellation_method** — Person within constellation of relationships. Intentional fragmentation — no single entity sees the whole Person.

**reputation_credentials** — Reputation becomes portable. VRCs carry trust across contexts without carrying identity.


## Interaction Model


See [references/interaction-model.md](references/interaction-model.md) for detailed persona-to-persona relationships.


## Constellation & Examples


See [references/constellation.md](references/constellation.md) for spellbook path, rationale, and example scenarios.


## Privacy Value Contribution


The Person IS V(π,t). The equation exists to measure value created by the Person's sovereignty. The Person's contribution is the behavioural data that surveillance capitalism extracts — the 7th capital.

By choosing sovereignty, the Person reclaims this capital. The 17×–12,000× gap is the difference between what the Person's data is worth to extractors versus in a sovereign architecture.

Every Person who chooses sovereignty increases N_eff, strengthens the binomial distribution across strata, and compounds A(τ).
