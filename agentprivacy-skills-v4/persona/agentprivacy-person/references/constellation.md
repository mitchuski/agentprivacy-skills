# The Person — First Person Seeker — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const PERSON_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // The seeker's journey (balanced draws from both)
  'act-04-blade-alone',
  'act-05-light-armor',
  'act-06-trust-graph',
  'act-07-mirror',
  'act-08-cookie-slash',
  'act-09-zcash-shield',
  'act-11-golden-split',
  'act-14-inscription-paths',
  'act-18-dragon-ceremony',

  // Parallel Society — the exit
  'parallel-exit', 'parallel-access',

  // Plurality — the coordination
  'plurality-opening',

  // Canon — understanding why
  'chapter-00-preface',
  'chapter-03-synthesis',
];
// Total: 17 spells
```

**Rationale:** The Person's constellation follows the armor progression (Blade→Light→Dragon) through First Person acts, includes the exit narrative (Parallel Society), and touches coordination (Plurality) and historical context (Canon). Broader than specialist but focused on the seeker's experience.


## Example Scenarios


**First contact.** Someone hears about privacy-first AI agents. Visits agentprivacy.ai. Reads a tale. Something resonates. Forms a sentence — their proverb. Sends it. No wallet needed. No technical knowledge required. Just engagement with an idea and a compressed response.

**Browser sovereignty.** Installs Swordsman browser agent. Cookies managed, trackers blocked, fingerprinting obscured. Fewer targeted ads, less behavioural manipulation. Blade tier — value before ceremony, guild, or deep understanding.

**Guild participation.** Progressed through Light tier. Joins a guild. Participates in governance, contributes to compression, earns reputation through demonstrated engagement. VRCs accumulate. Armor strengthens. Not just protected — sovereign.
