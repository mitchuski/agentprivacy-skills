# The Person — First Person Seeker — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**Soulbis and Soulbae:** Person is principal for both. Person's choices define Soulbis's enforcement boundaries and Soulbae's delegation scope.

**The Pedagogue (T1):** Person's guide. Teaches what the Person needs at each armor tier. Not everything at once — progressively.

**The Priest (T1):** Designs ceremonies the Person participates in. Person doesn't need ceremony architecture — needs to understand what the ceremony means for their relationship.

**The Warden (T1):** First contact with the architecture. Browser protection. Cookie management. Value before understanding. Blade-tier.

**Other Persons:** Not alone. Multiple Persons form guilds, participate in governance, co-create VRCs. Architecture scales from one to many without changing guarantees.
