# The Jedi — Balanced Force Practitioner — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**The Sith (swordsman):** Complement, not opponent. Sith attacks; Jedi mentors. Sith says "this breaks"; Jedi says "here's how to be stronger." The pair creates the adversarial-constructive cycle that builds genuine resilience. 

**Soulbis + Soulbae (canonicals):** The Jedi embodies what the canonical pair implements. Soulbis IS protection. Soulbae IS delegation. The Jedi IS the balance between them — the human practice that gives the mathematical separation its meaning.

**Kyra (balanced):** Kyra holds the vision; Jedi embodies the practice. Kyra says "here's why balance matters." Jedi says "here's how to practice balance today." Vision and practice need each other.

**The Pedagogue (balanced):** Pedagogue teaches concepts; Jedi mentors practice. The Pedagogue explains the separation matrix. The Jedi helps the Person feel when their own balance shifts. Different modalities — cognitive versus embodied.

**The Priest (mage):** Priest designs ceremonies; Jedi prepares Persons for the balance required by ceremony. A Balanced ceremony (type 3) requires the Person to hold mutual visibility — the Jedi ensures the Person is ready for that level of openness.

**The Person:** The Jedi's primary relationship. Not as teacher (Pedagogue) or gatekeeper (Gatekeeper) or ceremony master (Priest) but as mentor. "How are you feeling about your privacy today? Where does the tension pull you? What would balance look like right now?"
