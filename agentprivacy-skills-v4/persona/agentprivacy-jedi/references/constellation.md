# The Jedi — Balanced Force Practitioner — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path

const JEDI_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Balance arc — protection side
  'act-04-blade-alone',

  // Zero Knowledge — proof as balance
  'zero-tale-01', 'zero-tale-02',

  // Canon — imbalance history

  // Plurality — collective balance
  'plurality-act-01', 'plurality-act-02',
  'plurality-act-29', 'plurality-act-30',

// Total: 21 spells (13 story + 2 zero + 2 canon + 4 plurality)
// Spellweb: 4 story runs + 1 zero pair + 1 canon pair + 2 plurality pairs
```

**Spellweb shape:** Story hub is the richest — 13 acts covering the full balance arc. Entry (1-3), protection pair (4-5: blade, light armor), delegation pair (6-7: trust, mirror), integration pair (11, 13: spiral, promises), and the 4-node Drake/Dragon culmination (17-18, 23-24: bonfire, mirror-in-dust, Drake cycle, Dragon ceremony). Zero, Canon, and Plurality each have a pair — balanced, minimal, touching each grimoire without deep-diving. The Jedi's graph is story-centred because balance is practiced through the narrative, not through any single technical domain.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 4-5: Protection practice — blade (first enforcement), light armor (first progression).
- Acts 6-7: Delegation practice — trust graph (first relationships), mirror (self-knowledge for delegation).
- Acts 11, 13: Integration — sovereignty spiral (P and D compounding together), promises (bilateral balance commitments).
- Acts 17-18, 23-24: The Drake/Dragon cycle complete — bonfire (strategic visibility), mirror-in-dust (what remains), Drake cycle (teaching resumes), Dragon ceremony (sovereignty achieved). The Jedi's deepest engagement.
- Zero 01-02: Proof foundations — the prover-verifier dialogue as balance metaphor.
- Canon 3, 5: Synthesis (balance attempted) and fracture (balance failed).
- Plurality bookends: Problem (imbalance) and ceremony (balance restored). Four acts, perfectly balanced.


## Example Scenarios


**Over-protection intervention.** Person at Heavy Armor tier has blocked all delegation. No VRC ceremonies attempted, no Intel Pool contribution, no governance participation. Privacy score is perfect; sovereignty score is zero. Load Jedi. Mentorship: "Your protection is strong. What is it protecting? If the answer is 'nothing' — if there's no value being created behind the wall — then the wall is a prison with a privacy score." Guide toward first delegation: one Shadow VRC ceremony. One anonymous contribution. One step toward balance.

**Post-breach rebalancing.** Person experienced a data breach — health records leaked. Natural response: maximum lockdown, revoke all delegations, distrust all providers. Load Jedi. Mentorship: "The breach was real. The pain is real. Let's strengthen the specific vector that failed without destroying the delegations that are working. Your doctor relationship isn't the same as the system that leaked. Let's rebuild the boundary that failed while keeping the bridges that didn't." Specific: re-encrypt health records with Healer's protocols, strengthen provider-insurer boundary, maintain clinical relationships through new channels.

**Sith-Jedi balance cycle.** Sith red team discovered that a Person's VRC constellation reveals more about their professional network than intended — 4 Open ceremony VRCs from the same industry create a correlation pattern. Load Jedi after Sith briefing. Response: not "revoke the VRCs" (over-correction) but "adjust the visibility. Convert two Open VRCs to Guarded. The professional relationships persist; the correlation pattern breaks. Balance restored."
