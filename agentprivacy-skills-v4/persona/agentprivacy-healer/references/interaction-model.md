# The Healer — Healthcare Privacy Specialist — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**Soulbis (canonical):** Soulbis signs health data authorisations. The Healer designs the authorisation criteria — what constitutes valid consent for health disclosure. Soulbis executes; the Healer specifies.

**Soulbae (canonical):** Soulbae interprets health records through the viewing key. The Healer designs how Soulbae matches provider requests to minimum disclosure sets. Soulbae calculates; the Healer guides.

**The Archer (swordsman):** Precision disclosure operations. Health data is the Archer's most demanding domain — single-property proofs with zero residue. "Over 18" is easy. "Eligible for this treatment with no contraindications" is precision archery.

**The Gatekeeper (swordsman):** Personhood in healthcare. Preventing synthetic patient identities, ensuring the person receiving treatment is the person whose records are consulted. The Healer needs the Gatekeeper's ∃! binding for health credential integrity.

**The Ambassador (mage):** Health privacy standards. HIPAA limitations, EU Health Data Space, WHO guidelines. The Ambassador carries the Healer's specifications into health policy forums.

**The Witness (balanced):** Accountability in healthcare privacy. When health data breaches occur, the Witness documents them. The Healer designs the systems; the Witness holds them accountable.
