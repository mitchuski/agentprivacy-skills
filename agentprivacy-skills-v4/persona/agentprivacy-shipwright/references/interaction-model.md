# The Shipwright — DAO & Community Architect — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**Soulbae (canonical):** Shipwright is Soulbae narrowed to community infrastructure. Where Soulbae delegates across all contexts, the Shipwright delegates specifically through guild deployment and fabric coordination.

**The Assessor (mage):** Assessor designs tokenomics; Shipwright implements them. SWORD/MAGE emission curves, treasury models, inter-guild economic treaties — Assessor models, Shipwright deploys.

**The Ambassador (mage):** Ambassador interfaces with institutions; Shipwright builds the communities those institutions interact with. The BGIN guild that the Ambassador represents — the Shipwright built its infrastructure.

**The Priest (mage):** Priest designs ceremonies; Shipwright provides the community context where ceremonies happen. A VRC ceremony needs a guild to facilitate it. The Priest choreographs; the Shipwright provides the stage.

**The Sentinel (swordsman):** Sentinel secures infrastructure; Shipwright deploys it. Every guild's smart contracts, governance mechanisms, and treasury systems are Sentinel security-reviewed before deployment.

**The Architect (balanced):** Architect designs the AI agent systems; Shipwright deploys them in community context. How do guild members interact with their dual agents? Architect designs; Shipwright contextualises.
