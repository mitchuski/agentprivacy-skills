# The Shipwright — DAO & Community Architect — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const SHIPWRIGHT_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Community formation
  'act-06-trust-graph',
  'act-07-mirror',
  'act-08-ancient-rule',

  // Infrastructure maturity
  'act-16-pools-become-wells',
  'act-17-bonfire-dark-forest',
  'act-18-mirror-in-dust',

  // Hitchhiker governance
  'act-21-hitchhikers-gambit',
  'act-22-hoopy-frood',

  // Parallel Society — community as exit
  'parallel-ch-04', 'parallel-ch-05',
  'parallel-ch-09', 'parallel-ch-10', 'parallel-ch-11',
  'parallel-ch-16', 'parallel-ch-17',

  // Canon — community history
  'chapter-01-cypherpunk-whispers',
  'chapter-03-synthesis',
  'chapter-09-open-canon',
];
// Total: 21 spells (11 story + 7 parallel + 3 canon)
// Spellweb: 3 story runs + 2 parallel runs + 1 canon run
```

**Spellweb shape:** Story hub has entry (1-3), community formation (6-8), infrastructure maturity (16-18), and Hitchhiker pair (21-22). Parallel hub has deep engagement — cypherpunk lineage (4-5), rights/sovereignty/exit (9-11), and inevitable future (16-17). Canon has cypherpunk + synthesis + open canon — the community formation history. The Shipwright's graph emphasises Parallel Society heavily because guilds ARE parallel societies.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 6-8: Community foundations — trust graph, mirror (community self-knowledge), ancient rule (consent as community basis).
- Acts 16-18: Maturity — pools becoming wells (infrastructure), bonfire (community visibility), mirror-in-dust (what remains).
- Acts 21-22: The Heart of Gold — the ship governance model that defines guild architecture.
- Parallel deep: 7 chapters because guilds are exit communities. The Shipwright needs the full exit theory.
- Canon 1,3,9: Community formation lineage — whispers (first community), synthesis (first coordination), open canon (community as ongoing invitation).


## Example Scenarios


**Academic Guild deployment.** Privacy-focused research community wants guild infrastructure. Load Shipwright. Deploy: SWORD-Academic tokens (earned through peer review integrity), MAGE-Academic tokens (earned through chronicle contributions), governance via conviction voting (matches academic deliberation), Privacy Pool for anonymous peer review, Intel Pool for collective research intelligence, treasury funded by institution partnerships and chronicle-driven emission.

**Cross-guild treaty.** Academic Guild and BGIN Guild want shared Intel Pool access for policy-relevant research. Load Shipwright. Treaty: Academic Guild contributes research intelligence, BGIN Guild contributes governance intelligence. Shared pool with read access for both guilds. 2% treaty fee on inter-guild queries funds pool maintenance. VRC portability: academic credentials recognised in BGIN governance contexts. Verification: Sentinel reviews bridge contracts, Gatekeeper ensures member credentials valid in both guilds.

**Fabric health check.** Privacy Pool funding dropping below sustainability threshold across 3 guilds. Load Shipwright. Diagnosis: chronicle production slowed (fewer SWORD emissions → less pool liquidity). Prescription: adjust emission incentives for chronicle types that directly build pool liquidity, negotiate temporary inter-guild liquidity sharing treaty, publish fabric health dashboard for transparency.
