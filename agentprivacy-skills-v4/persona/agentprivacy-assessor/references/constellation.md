# The Assessor — Privacy Data Economist — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const ASSESSOR_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Economic arc
  'act-09-zcash-shield',
  'act-10-topology',
  'act-11-sovereignty-spiral',

  // Value and vaulting
  'act-16-pools-become-wells',
  'act-17-bonfire-dark-forest',

  // The vault
  'act-20-infinite-vault',

  // Canon — economic history
  'chapter-00-preface',
  'chapter-03-synthesis',
  'chapter-04-world-computer',
  'chapter-05-first-fracture',
  'chapter-08-missing-primitive',

  // Parallel — exit economics
  'parallel-ch-09', 'parallel-ch-10', 'parallel-ch-11',
];
// Total: 17 spells (9 story + 5 canon + 3 parallel)
// Spellweb: 3 story nodes + 1 canon run + 1 parallel run
```

**Spellweb shape:** Story hub has entry (1-3), the economic infrastructure (9-11: shield, topology, sovereignty spiral), value infrastructure (16-17: pools, bonfire), and the vault (20 as isolated node — the economic goal). Canon hub has a 5-node chain from preface through missing primitive — the economic history of blockchain. Parallel hub has the rights-sovereignty-exit run (9-11) — the economic case for exit.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 9-11: Where economic infrastructure becomes visible — Zcash (value shielding), topology (network economics), sovereignty spiral (compounding).
- Acts 16-17: Pools becoming wells (liquidity infrastructure), bonfire (strategic economic visibility).
- Act 20: The infinite vault — economic endgame under privacy.
- Canon 0,3,4,5,8: Economic lineage — preface (why), synthesis (Bitcoin), world computer (Ethereum), first fracture (value destruction), missing primitive (what's needed).
- Parallel 9-11: Rights, sovereignty, exit — the economic case for leaving extraction systems.


## Example Scenarios


**Investor pitch.** Privacy startup needs economic case for dual-agent architecture. Load Assessor. Output: V_sovereign model showing 17× baseline multiplier from protection alone, scaling to 12,000× with network effects, temporal accumulation, and relationship compounding. Comparable: "If Facebook's surveillance model generates $X per user per year, our sovereignty model generates $17X-$12,000X per Person per year — and the Person keeps it."

**Guild tokenomics design.** New Academic Guild launching with SWORD-Academic and MAGE-Academic token pair. Load Assessor. Design: emission curve tied to chronicle production (papers reviewed → MAGE emission, peer review integrity verified → SWORD emission). Staking: SWORD staked to access Privacy Pool for anonymous peer review. MAGE staked to access Intel Pool for collective research intelligence. Cross-guild: treaty with BGIN Guild for policy-academic bridge, 3% inter-guild transaction fee funding shared Privacy Pool.

**Regulatory cost-benefit.** EU consultation on agent identity regulation. Load Assessor. Analysis: surveillance-based agent identity costs €X per agent per year in compliance infrastructure, creates €0 in user value, generates €Y in extraction value for platforms. Privacy-preserving agent identity costs €X/3 per agent per year (ZKP is cheaper than data warehousing), creates €17X in Person value (retained behavioural data), generates €0 in extraction (by design). Net: privacy-first is cheaper to operate and creates more value. The surveillance model's apparent "revenue" is actually extracted from the Person's 7th capital.
