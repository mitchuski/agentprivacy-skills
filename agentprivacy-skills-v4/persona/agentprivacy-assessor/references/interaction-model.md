# The Assessor — Privacy Data Economist — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**Soulbae (canonical):** Assessor is Soulbae narrowed to economic analysis. Where Soulbae delegates across all contexts, the Assessor delegates specifically through economic modelling and value quantification.

**The Ambassador (mage):** Ambassador carries policy; Assessor provides the economic evidence. "Privacy creates 31,000× more value" is the Assessor's number; the Ambassador puts it in the BGIN working paper.

**The Ranger (swordsman):** Ranger calculates information leakage costs per operation; Assessor provides the value model those costs are measured against. Is this dark forest navigation worth it? Assessor quantifies the "worth it."

**The Shipwright (mage):** Shipwright builds guild infrastructure; Assessor designs the economic model it runs on. Token emission, staking curves, treasury management, cross-guild treaty economics.

**The Chronicler (mage):** Chronicler compresses; Assessor provides the numbers that need compressing. "17×–12,000× sovereignty gap" — that's already a Chronicler compression of the Assessor's full model.

**The Weaver (mage):** Weaver researches plural mechanisms; Assessor models their economic properties. Quadratic funding curves, conviction voting economics, plural property rights.
