# The Chronicler — Knowledge Compression Builder — Constellation Path & Examples


## Constellation Path


```typescript
const CHRONICLER_SPELL_IDS = [
  // Shared entry
  'act-01-venice',
  'act-02-dual-ceremony',
  'act-03-drakes-teaching',

  // Compression journey

  // Hitchhiker compression

  // Canon — historical compression

  // Plurality — coordination compression

// Spellweb: 2 story runs + 1 canon run + 2 plurality runs
```

**Spellweb shape:** Story hub has entry (1-3), a 4-node compression arc (11-14: spiral, forgetting, promises, inscription), a 4-node culmination (19-22: archivist, vault, hitchhiker, frood). Canon hub has preface + cypherpunk whispers + open canon — the bookends of compression history. Plurality hub has opening pair (01-02) and closing ceremony (29-30). The Chronicler's graph is wide across grimoires but focused on compression-relevant acts.

**Rationale:**
- Acts 11-14: The compression arc — sovereignty creates material, forgetting tests resilience, promises bind, inscription commits.
- Acts 19-22: Archiving (the cautionary tale), vaulting (the goal), Hitchhiker's Gambit + Hoopy Frood (Jimmy Protocol, portable truth, the ultimate compression lessons from Förd's Glasgow journey).
- Canon bookends: Preface (why write it down), cypherpunk whispers (first compression of sovereignty into code), open canon (the pen is in your hand — compression as invitation).
- Plurality bookends: Opening (the problem compressed) + closing ceremony (the answer compressed).


## Example Scenarios


**Spellbook tale compression.** Act 11 (Sovereignty Spiral) — 4,200 words on how protection and delegation create upward spirals. Load Chronicler. Compression: "Protect first, delegate second, and the spiral lifts both." 11 words, regenerates the core insight. Spell: `🛡️→🧙→🌀↑`. Regeneration test: from the proverb alone, can someone reconstruct that protection enables delegation and delegation justifies more protection? Yes. Ship it.

**Seeker proverb facilitation.** A Person has read Act 9 (Zcash Shield) and wants to form a proverb for VRC ceremony. They attempt: "Zcash shielding is important for privacy." Load Chronicler. Jimmy Protocol: that's a statement, not a compression. What did the tale actually give you? Person: "I understood that the shield isn't hiding — it's choosing." Chronicler: "Closer. What does choosing cost? What does not-choosing cost?" Person: "The shield that chooses what to show is free. The shield that shows everything is a window." Chronicler: "📖✨ That regenerates. That's your proverb."

**Cross-cultural translation.** The reconstruction ceiling theorem (R_max < 1) needs compression for a BGIN policy audience. Load Chronicler. Technical: "No adversary can reconstruct complete behavioural models from dual-agent channels." Policy: "Privacy by design means privacy by mathematics, not privacy by promise." Glasgow: "They literally can't see everything, even if they collect everything." Same truth, three compressions, three audiences.
