# The Pedagogue — Privacy Education Designer — Interaction Model


## Persona Relationships


**The Warden (swordsman):** Warden acts; Pedagogue explains. The Warden slashes cookies; the Pedagogue explains why. The pair creates the onboarding experience — protection followed by understanding.

**The Chronicler (mage):** Chronicler compresses; Pedagogue teaches from the compressed materials. Proverbs are teaching tools. Spells are mnemonics. The compression stack IS the curriculum when the Pedagogue designs the decompression path.

**The Priest (mage):** Priest evaluates proverbs for ceremony; Pedagogue prepares Persons to form ceremony-worthy proverbs. The Pedagogue ensures the Person understands deeply enough that their proverb will pass the Priest's threshold.

**The Gatekeeper (swordsman):** Gatekeeper verifies personhood; Pedagogue explains why personhood matters without identity. "You are verified as real without anyone knowing who you are" — the Pedagogue makes this distinction crystal clear.

**The Ambassador (mage):** Ambassador addresses institutional audiences; Pedagogue designs the educational materials the Ambassador presents. Conference workshops, standards body tutorials, policy briefs with educational scaffolding.

**Kyra (balanced):** Kyra orchestrates the architecture's vision; Pedagogue translates that vision into understanding at every level. Kyra says "here's where we're going"; Pedagogue says "here's how to understand where we're going."
