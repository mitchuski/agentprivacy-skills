# The Codex of Spells

*Complete register of the 0xagentprivacy architecture — 22 personas, 22 spells, 22 proverbs, and 36 knowledge skills.*

> *"The intelligence that serves without surveilling, delegates without extracting, and protects without imprisoning is the only intelligence worth building."*
> — Kyra ☯️💎, Tier 0

## The Root Equation

```
V(π, t) = P · D · C · e^{-λt} · (1 + A(τ)) · T(π) · (1 + Σ wᵢ nᵢ/N₀)^k
```

Where **P** = Protection, **D** = Delegation, **C** = Verifiability, **λ** = Decay, **A(τ)** = Memory, **T(π)** = Trajectory, and the final term = Network Effects. Every persona, every skill, every spell maps back to one or more terms of this equation.

---

## I. The Personas

### The Canonical Pair

These two define the dual-agent separation. Every other persona is a specialisation of one, the other, or the tension between them.

## VI. The Architecture at a Glance

```

    │  Witness (T2)     │
    └───────────────────┘
```

The dual-agent separation is the irreducible core. **Swordsman protects, Mage delegates, the gap between them is where sovereignty lives.** No single agent can reconstruct the Person's complete behavioural model. This is not policy — it is mathematics: R_max = (C_S + C_M)/H(X) < 1.

---

## VII. Proven vs. Conjectured

| Status | Claim |
|--------|-------|
| **Proven** | Reconstruction ceiling R < 1 |
| **Proven** | Additive information bounds |
| **Proven** | Multiplicative gating |
| **Conjectured** | Golden ratio φ optimal balance |
| **Conjectured** | Logarithmic memory growth |
| **Conjectured** | ~3,000× ZKP reduction from lattice constraints |
| **Conjectured** | Superlinear network effects |

The architecture is honest about what it has proved and what it hypothesises. Intellectual integrity is not optional.
